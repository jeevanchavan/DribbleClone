# DribbleClone
Here, I've Implemented Dribble Clone to Practice SCSS and Responsiveness. Mobile and Desktop View apply practical Skills to Improve

DribbleClone

A sleek and responsive front-end replica of Dribbble, built to master SCSS and responsive design.

🚀 What this project does

Recreates the look and feel of a modern designer showcase site (like Dribbble) using HTML, CSS/SCSS, and responsive layouts.

Supports both mobile and desktop views — perfect for practising layout changes across device sizes.

Demonstrates strong use of SCSS features (nesting, variables, mixins, etc) to architect clean and maintainable styles.

A great learning playground for front-end developers who want to build UI-first and polish their styling skills.

📚 Why this is worth checking out

It’s a hands-on project: instead of just following tutorials, you’re building something visually impactful and real-world inspired.

Shows solid front-end craftsmanship: focusing on responsive breakpoints, semantic markup, and modern CSS techniques.

Expands your portfolio: a nice showing of your ability to replicate a polished UI and manage styling at scale.

Helps you grow: you’ll learn how to think about layout shifts, mobile first, and style structuring via SCSS.

🔍 What to look at / try

Inspect the SCSS folder: notice how variables (colors, typography), mixins (for breakpoints), and modules (components) are organised.

Resize your browser window: see how the layout adapts, how the grid changes, and how mobile menu is handled.

View the code for HTML structure: check semantics, ALT texts, heading hierarchy — good practice for accessibility too.

Consider extending: maybe add hover states, dark mode support, image lazy-loading, or a small JS interaction to make it more dynamic.
